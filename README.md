# CScout


This is the code for my thesis, it can be run using the data created at Context Scout. The NonSequential_Models.ipynb acts as data processing for both notebooks and the conventional models in my thesis. The Sequential_Models.ipynb runs all of the experiments I ran with a sequential model (Bi-GRU) in my thesis.

The final model using a CNN-GRU is unable to be uploaded as I do not own the rights to it.
